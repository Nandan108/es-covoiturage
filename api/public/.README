This directory is the default Laravel \"public\" folder, but the project is served
from the repository root `public/` directory instead.

Static event images are exposed via `public/images/events` (symlinked to
`api/storage/images`). The legacy `api/public/images` symlink is removed during
application boot to avoid confusion.
